    - Run Hyperspin-Fe flawlessly
    - Run nullDC (Dreamcast) and possible Dolphin (Gamecube) flawlessly
        - As well as older consoles, possibly also PS2?

Controller
    - Wireless
    - PS3 - expensive but good
        - Button layout compared to Xbox, Dreamcast, Gamecube, will it be fine?
